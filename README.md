# Swatchify
So building on Shopify's existing swatch selector found [HERE](https://help.shopify.com/themes/customization/showcase-products/add-color-swatches), follow the guide there, then we'll make a few adjustments.
This addition gives you a bit more versatility when you have two different variant selectors, the two most common being size and colour, and updating out of stock variants as you switch between colours, allowing the user to quickly get the information they need.

This method doesn't use the default soldout.png image - but it's preserved in there and can be added with a few modifications. There may be a few issues with implementation I've overlooked, just let me know if there are and I'll update the guide.
